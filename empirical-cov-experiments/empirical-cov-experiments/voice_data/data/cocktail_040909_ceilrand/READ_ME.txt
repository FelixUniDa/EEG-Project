For this data set Any Cocktail party rcording (party<1 or 2 or 3>.wav) can be mixed with any any of the individual recording (soi<1...6>.wav). None of the speakers of intereset(soi) is present in any of the party recordings. This is a modification to the previous data sets. This will allow researchers to try more experimental variations.
