help rng
 <strong>rng</strong> Control the random number generator used by RAND, RANDI, and RANDN.
    <strong>rng</strong>(SD) seeds the random number generator using the non-negative
    integer SD so that RAND, RANDI, and RANDN produce a predictable
    sequence of numbers.
 
    <strong>rng</strong>('shuffle') seeds the random number generator based on the current
    time so that RAND, RANDI, and RANDN produce a different sequence of
    numbers after each time you call <strong>rng</strong>.
 
    <strong>rng</strong>(SD,GENERATOR) and <strong>rng</strong>('shuffle',GENERATOR) additionally specify the
    type of the random number generator used by RAND, RANDI, and RANDN.
    GENERATOR is one of:
 
        Generator              Description
       ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
       'twister'               Mersenne Twister
       'simdTwister'           SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister
       'combRecursive'         Combined Multiple Recursive
       'multFibonacci'         Multiplicative Lagged Fibonacci
       'v5uniform'             Legacy MATLAB 5.0 uniform generator
       'v5normal'              Legacy MATLAB 5.0 normal generator
       'v4'                    Legacy MATLAB 4.0 generator
 
    <strong>rng</strong>('default') puts the settings of the random number generator used by
    RAND, RANDI, and RANDN to their default values so that they produce the
    same random numbers as if you restarted MATLAB. In this release, the
    default settings are the Mersenne Twister with seed 0.
 
    SCURR = <strong>rng</strong> returns the current settings of the random number generator
    used by RAND, RANDI, and RANDN. The settings are returned in a
    structure SCURR with fields 'Type', 'Seed', and 'State'.
     
    <strong>rng</strong>(S) restores the settings of the random number generator used by
    RAND, RANDI, and RANDN back to the values captured previously by
    S = <strong>rng</strong>.
 
    SPREV = <strong>rng</strong>(...) returns the previous settings of the random number
    generator used by RAND, RANDI, and RANDN before changing the settings.
 
       Example 1: Retrieve and Restore Generator Settings
          s = rng           % get the current generator settings
          x = rand(1,5)     % RAND generates some values
          rng(s)            % restore the generator settings
          y = rand(1,5)     % generate the same values so x and y are equal
  
       Example 2: Restore Settings for Legacy Generator
          prevS = rng(0,'v5uniform') % use legacy generator, save previous settings
          x = rand                   % legacy startup value .9501
          rng(prevS)                 % restore the previous settings
 
    See <a href="matlab:helpview([docroot '\techdoc\math\math.map'],'update_random_number_generator')">Updating Your Random Number Generator Syntax</a> to use <strong>rng</strong> to replace
    RAND or RANDN with the 'seed', 'state', or 'twister' inputs.

help eigs
 <strong>eigs</strong>  Find a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix
    D = <strong>eigs</strong>(A) returns a vector of A's 6 largest magnitude eigenvalues.
    A must be square and should be large and sparse.
 
    [V,D] = <strong>eigs</strong>(A) returns a diagonal matrix D of A's 6 largest magnitude
    eigenvalues and a matrix V whose columns are the corresponding
    eigenvectors.
 
    [V,D,FLAG] = <strong>eigs</strong>(A) also returns a convergence flag. If FLAG is 0 then
    all the eigenvalues converged; otherwise not all converged.
 
    <strong>eigs</strong>(A,B) solves the generalized eigenvalue problem A*V == B*V*D. B must be
    the same size as A. <strong>eigs</strong>(A,[],...) indicates the standard eigenvalue problem
    A*V == V*D.
 
    <strong>eigs</strong>(A,K) and <strong>eigs</strong>(A,B,K) return the K largest magnitude eigenvalues.
 
    <strong>eigs</strong>(A,K,SIGMA) and <strong>eigs</strong>(A,B,K,SIGMA) return K eigenvalues. If SIGMA is:
       'LM' or 'SM' - Largest or Smallest Magnitude
    For real symmetric problems, SIGMA may also be:
       'LA' or 'SA' - Largest or Smallest Algebraic
       'BE' - Both Ends, one more from high end if K is odd
    For nonsymmetric or complex problems, SIGMA may also be:
       'LR' or 'SR' - Largest or Smallest Real part
       'LI' or 'SI' - Largest or Smallest Imaginary part
    If SIGMA is a real or complex scalar including 0, <strong>eigs</strong> finds the
    eigenvalues closest to SIGMA.
 
    <strong>eigs</strong>(A,K,SIGMA,OPTS) and <strong>eigs</strong>(A,B,K,SIGMA,OPTS) specify options:
    OPTS.issym: symmetry of A or A-SIGMA*B represented by AFUN [{false} |
    true]
    OPTS.isreal: complexity of A or A-SIGMA*B represented by AFUN [false | {true}]
    OPTS.tol: convergence: Ritz estimate residual <= tol*NORM(A) [scalar | {eps}]
    OPTS.maxit: maximum number of iterations [integer | {300}]
    OPTS.p: number of Lanczos vectors: K+1<p<=N [integer | {2K}]
    OPTS.v0: starting vector [N-by-1 vector | {randomly generated}]
    OPTS.disp: diagnostic information display level [{0} | 1 | 2]
    OPTS.cholB: B is actually its Cholesky factor CHOL(B) [{false} | true]
    OPTS.permB: sparse B is actually CHOL(B(permB,permB)) [permB | {1:N}]
    Use CHOL(B) instead of B when SIGMA is a string other than 'SM'.
 
    <strong>eigs</strong>(AFUN,N) accepts the function AFUN instead of the matrix A. AFUN is
    a function handle and Y = AFUN(X) should return
       A*X            if SIGMA is unspecified, or a string other than 'SM'
       A\X            if SIGMA is 0 or 'SM'
       (A-SIGMA*I)\X  if SIGMA is a nonzero scalar (standard problem)
       (A-SIGMA*B)\X  if SIGMA is a nonzero scalar (generalized problem)
    N is the size of A. The matrix A, A-SIGMA*I or A-SIGMA*B represented by
    AFUN is assumed to be real and nonsymmetric unless specified otherwise
    by OPTS.isreal and OPTS.issym. In all these <strong>eigs</strong> syntaxes, <strong>eigs</strong>(A,...)
    may be replaced by <strong>eigs</strong>(AFUN,N,...).
 
    Example:
       A = delsq(numgrid('C',15));  d1 = eigs(A,5,'SM');
 
    Equivalently, if dnRk is the following one-line function:
       %----------------------------%
       function y = dnRk(x,R,k)
       y = (delsq(numgrid(R,k))) \ x;
       %----------------------------%
 
       n = size(A,1);  opts.issym = 1;
       d2 = eigs(@(x)dnRk(x,'C',15),n,5,'SM',opts);

help cellstr
 <strong>cellstr</strong> Create cell array of strings from character array.
    C = <strong>cellstr</strong>(S) places each row of the character array S into
    separate cells of C.
 
    Use CHAR to convert back.
 
    Another way to create a cell array of strings is by using the curly
    braces:
       C = {'hello' 'yes' 'no' 'goodbye'};
