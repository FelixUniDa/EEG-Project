This is RADICAL release 1.2. 

Changes from version 1.1:

A bug was found in the parameter settings in RADICAL.m. Setting AUG_FLAG
to 0 had no effect.

Now, setting AUG_FLAG to 0 has the appropriate behavior. When AUG_FLAG=0,
no "smoothing points" or auxiliary points are used. This greatly increases
the speed of the algorithm, while reducing the accuracy when there is not
enough data. 

Changes from version 1.0:

1) A major bug was found and fixed from
   version 1.0. The whitening matrix was computed incorrectly in previous
   versions. The program worked correctly for pre-whitened data but not
   for non-white data. 

2) The speed has been increased about 20% by changes to the vasicekm.m
   routine.

The following functions are found the RADICAL home
directory.

RADICAL_2D:        Solves two-dimensional ICA problem.
RADICAL:           Solves ICA problem in 2 or more dimensions.  
fast_RADICAL:      Same as RADICAL, but has AUG_FLAG=0 (see above).
demo_2d:	   Shows usage of RADICAL_2D with a 2-d example.
demo_5d:	   Shows usage of RADICAL with a 5-d example.
demo_5d_fast:
